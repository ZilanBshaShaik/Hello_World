# Hello_World
This is my first practise on GitHub with creation of a repository named as Hello_world.
Hello Humans!

Basha here, I like DevOps and Bash_Script (that's what I'm made of..!)
I've had tacosm on moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

Got to know how to crearte an empty repository and a branch from this GitHub tutorials. Thanks to the GitHub Team.
